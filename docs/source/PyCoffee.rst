26-08-2018: Julien Milli about Using Principal Component Analysis with images 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    
  * Principal component Analysis is generally used for dimensionality reduction (data compression or multidimensional data visualisation), or to identify driving factors in multidimensional data clouds. In high contrast imaging, this is used to estimate the glare and speckle halo of the central star, in order to reveal underlying astrophysical signal from a planet or a disk.  developed a suite of tools in Python to perform a PCA with images and help the interpretation of those principal components, and I propose to explain those in this pycoffee, along with the basic maths behind PCA. 



30-08-2018: Alessandro Razza about  SExtractor with Python (I)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  
  * SExtractor remains a valuable tool to build a catalog of objects from an astronomical image. All the main SExtractor features are now built-in a python library (photutils) which is computationally efficient and highly customizable. In this informal talk, I show how to compute a SExtractor-like background of an image and how to extract a list of sources with their properties as a python table. No particular python skills are required, although previous knowledge of SExtrator and/or a basic understanding of python syntax can be of some help.                                                                                           

6-09-2018: Alessandro Razza about  SExtractor with Python (II)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  * In this second and last part of the talk on using SExtractor with python, I will focus on the source extraction process and output data visualization.\n
