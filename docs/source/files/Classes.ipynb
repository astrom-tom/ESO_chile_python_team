    "# Python Object Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented programming is a widely used concept for writting powerful applications. We will try to cover the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  How to create a class\n",
    "2.  Instantiating objects\n",
    "3.  Adding attributes to a class\n",
    "4.  Defining methods within a class\n",
    "5.  Passing arguments to a method\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is based on the imperative programming paradigm, which uses statements to change a program's state. It focuses on describing how a program should operate. Examples of imperative programming languages are C, C++, Java, Go, Ruby and Python. This stands in contrast to declarative programming, which focuses on what the computer program should accomplish, without specifying how. Examples are database query languages like SQL and XQuery, where one only tells the computer what data to query from where, but not how to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP uses the concept of objects and classes. A class can be thought of as a 'blueprint' for objects. These can have their own attributes (characteristics they possess), and methods (actions they perform).\n",
    "\n",
    "## An Example\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a class is the class `Dog`. Don't think of it as a specific dog, or your own dog. We're describing what a dog __is__ and __can do__, in general. Dogs usually have a __name__ and __age__; these are ___instance attributes__. Dogs can also __bark__; this is a __method__.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you talk about a __specific dog__, you would have an __object__ in programming: an object is an __instantiation of a class__. This is the basic principle on which object-oriented programming is based. So my dog `Snoopy`, for example, belongs to the class `Dog`. His attributes are `name = 'Ozzy'` and `age = '2'`. _A different dog will have different attributes_.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to create a class in python\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a class in Python, you can use the `class` keyword, followed by the class name (startin with a capital letter by convention) and a colon. Inside the class, an `__init__` method has to be defined with `def`. _This is the initializer that you can later use to instantiate objects_. `__init__` must always be present! It takes one argument: `self`, which refers to the object itself. Inside the method, the pass keyword is used as of now, because Python expects you to type something there. Remember to use correct indentation!"

It takes `self`, as per usual, and `friend` as arguments. In this case, friend will be another `Dog` object. Set the `self.friend` attribute to `friend`, and the `friend.friend` attribute to `self`. This means that the relationship is reciprocal; you are your friend's friend. In this case, `Goofy` will be `Snoopy`'s friend, which means that `Snoopy` automatically becomes `Goofy`'s buddy. You could also set these attributes manually, instead of defining a method, but that would require more work (writing 2 lines of code instead of 1) every time you want to set a friend.
