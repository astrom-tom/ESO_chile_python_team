15-01-2019: Frederic P.A. Vogt : Tapping into the ADS with Python 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The astroquery module allows to easily query the ADS with Python. Here, I propose to use this module to assemble a simple script that computes one's publication statistics automatically. The tasks involved (list manipulation, basic plotting) are ideal for beginners and intermediate users to develop their programming skills. Advanced users may use the datasets involved to explore a range of data manipulation and fitting routines. The goal is for every participant to go home with a fully working script able to automatically update their publication statistics.

See with frederic if you want to retrieve the code. A bug was discovered during that hackday in the astroquery module. Bug reported and fixed by astropy people!!: https://github.com/astropy/astroquery/issues/1336
