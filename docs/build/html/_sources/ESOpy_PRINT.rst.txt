PRINT - ESOpy4.0
----------------
----------------
This is the webpage of PRINT - ESOpy4.0 organized in April 2020 at ESO chile.

Rationale
^^^^^^^^^

WHY?
====
The Python programming language is one of the most used programming language in the world. It is used on a daily basis by one of the biggest companies in the world like Google, Yahoo, IBM, Nokia, etcâ€¦ In the science world the use of python is growing fast as well. The LHC is using python, NASA is using python (JWST pipelines are written primarily in python), ESO is becoming python-friendly (with SciOpsPy) and the E-ELT will make great use of it.
In this spirit, the python team decided to organize a third edition of the Python Boot camp that had a great success a year ago. The ESOpy v3.0 aims at providing a (non-exhaustive) overview of the python language and its use in science and operations.
 
WHAT?
=====
The V4.0 of the camp (aka PRINT: Python foR dummIes in quarantiNe) will be dedicated to python beginners and span two mornings.
The goal is to get familiar with Python and the basics of the langauge: Libraries, datatypes, data collections, FITS file handling, basic plotting, scripting, functions and classes. No requirements are needed, except having python (3.5+) installed on your laptop.
 
 
WHEN AND WHERE?
===============
PRINT - ESOpy4.0 will take place remotely on the 27th and 28th of April.

Getting ready for the bootcamp
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can find here the python installation document :download:`here <./files/print/PRINT_requirements.pdf>`. Please come on the workshop with everything installed. We will not have time to spend time installing >30 python environment.

Any problem with the installation?
