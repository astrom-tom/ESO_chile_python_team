* **26-08-2018**: Julien Milli about Using Principal Component Analysis with images 
    
  * Principal component Analysis is generally used for dimensionality reduction (data compression or multidimensional data visualisation), or to identify driving factors in multidimensional data clouds. In high contrast imaging, this is used to estimate the glare and speckle halo of the central star, in order to reveal underlying astrophysical signal from a planet or a disk.  developed a suite of tools in Python to perform a PCA with images and help the interpretation of those principal components, and I propose to explain those in this pycoffee, along with the basic maths behind PCA.
